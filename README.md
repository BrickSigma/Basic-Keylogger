This is a basic keylogger I made that will record and write all keyboard inputs into a text file, called Data.txt..

Feel free to suggest improvements to the code, this is my first project to post so I'm open to any changes and edits.

To run the program you'll first have to install the "keyboard" package using `pip install keyboard`
